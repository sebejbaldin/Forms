### Other thing

I think that one interesting thing of this project are the autocomplete functions you can find in the **util.js** file and obviously if you want to copy it you are free to do!
They need *JQuery* as dependency and the file **customStyle.css**.
The first param is on both a *JQuery* object, the second vary on the function.

For the AJAX function is the url to connect that return the array to use, the other requires directly an array.
